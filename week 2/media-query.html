            <h2>2 Nephi 2</h2>
            <p>27 Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they
            are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death,
            according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.</p>

            <p>4 And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of
            Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in
            Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.</p>
